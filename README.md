# Calculator

Simple web-based calculator built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Decimal input and clear
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

## Files
- `index.html` — UI and markup
- `script.js` — application logic
- `style.css` — styles
- `.vscode/settings.json` — editor settings

## Usage
1. Open [Calculator/index.html](Calculator/index.html) in your web browser.
2. (Optional) Serve the folder with a local dev server (recommended for some browsers):

```bash
npx http-server Calculator

```

## Development
- Edit `script.js` to change behavior. Reload the page to see changes.

## Notes
Keep the files together in the `Calculator` folder. If you want, I can add screenshots or a demo GIF next.
